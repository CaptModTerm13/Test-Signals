# Sine Wave Plotting Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to plot both continuous and discrete sine waves using MATLAB. It includes a MATLAB script that generates and visualizes a sine wave with a specified frequency and sampling rate. The plot shows both continuous and discrete representations of the sine wave.

## Files

- `sine_wave_plot.m`: MATLAB script to generate and plot the continuous and discrete sine waves.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `sine_wave_plot.m` file.
3. Run the script by typing `sine_wave_plot` in the MATLAB command window.

```matlab
sine_wave_plot
